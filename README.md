# DevControl

## Project structure

This project has three distinct parts:

- Device: multiple ways to build a embedded Linux system, including a custom package manager prototype written in Haskell
- Hub: a REST API aiming to provide an UI for the device configuration. Written in Node, using SQLite database and Svelte for frontend.
- Relay: todo: a relay server to provide surface for the devices to connect.

This project is part of my master's thesis.
